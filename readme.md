Spring Boot Microservices Documentation
=======================================

Introduction
------------

This is a Spring Boot microservices application that utilizes Spring Cloud components for service discovery and routing. The application is composed of two microservices, a restaurant service and an order service, both of which share a common MySQL database for data storage. A gateway is used to receive API calls and direct them to the appropriate microservice. The application also incorporates Eureka for service discovery, Zuul for gateway routing, and Zipkin for distributed tracing. All services are containerized using Docker and can be easily deployed using Docker Compose.

Architecture
------------

The application is designed using the Service-Oriented Application (SOA) pattern, which emphasizes the creation of autonomous and modular services that can be easily scaled, updated, and replaced.

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the application:

As shown in the diagram, the application is composed of three main components:

-   Gateway: A Spring Cloud Zuul gateway that receives API calls and routes them to the appropriate microservice.
-   Microservices: Two microservices, restaurant service and order service, that perform specific business logic and communicate with the common MySQL database.
-   Database: A MySQL database that is shared by both microservices.

Each microservice is registered with Eureka for service discovery, which enables the gateway to automatically discover and route requests to the appropriate service.

Prerequisites
-------------

To run the application, the following software is required:

-   Docker
-   Docker Compose

Getting Started
---------------

To run the application, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository using the following command:

bashCopy code

`git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/spring-boot-microservices.git`

1.  Navigate to the project directory and build the Docker images for each service using the following command:

Copy code

`docker-compose build`

1.  Start the containers using the following command:

Copy code

`docker-compose up`

1.  Verify that the services are running correctly by accessing the following URLs:

-   Eureka Server: <http://localhost:8761/>
-   Zipkin Server: <http://localhost:9411/>
-   Restaurant Service: <http://localhost:8081/>
-   Order Service: <http://localhost:8082/>
-   Gateway: <http://localhost:8080/>

API Endpoints
-------------

The following API endpoints are available:

### Restaurant Service

-   GET /restaurants - Retrieves a list of all restaurants.
-   GET /restaurants/{id} - Retrieves a specific restaurant by ID.
-   POST /restaurants - Creates a new restaurant.
-   PUT /restaurants/{id} - Updates an existing restaurant.
-   DELETE /restaurants/{id} - Deletes a specific restaurant by ID.

### Order Service

-   GET /orders - Retrieves a list of all orders.
-   GET /orders/{id} - Retrieves a specific order by ID.
-   POST /orders - Creates a new order.
-   PUT /orders/{id} - Updates an existing order.
-   DELETE /orders/{id} - Deletes a specific order by ID.

Conclusion
----------

This Spring Boot microservices application demonstrates how to implement a Service-Oriented Architecture using Spring Cloud components. By containerizing the services using Docker and deploying them using Docker Compose, the application can be easily deployed and scaled as needed.
